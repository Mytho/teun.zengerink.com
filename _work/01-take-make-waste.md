    Clothes, mobile phones, plastic packaging. Short life span and over production, aimed at single use and new models. We’re mostly focused on the end product.<br />
    <br />
    The raw materials that are needed, the withdrawal of natural resources from the earth: we’re scarcely realising the influence on our living environment. What happens to the products after their life span has expired, is non-essential. Take, Make, Waste.<br />
    <br />
    The impact of this mode of life on our habitat is big. This project is the result of a search for how this thinking pattern shapes the Western Harber of Amsterdam. Most of the time the effects are clearly visible in an industrial area. Sometimes the truth is disguised and hidden beneath the surface.<br />
    <br />
    01 - Transshipment terminal at a former refinery. With a total capacity of over 1 million m3 divided over 69 tanks one of Amsterdam's most important terminals for gasoline and LPG.<br />
    <br />
    02 - The company states environmental protections is one of their core values. In their trade they adhere to the environmental standards. Apparently, complying to these standards equals environmental protection.<br />
    <br />
    03 - On the border of the port area a recreational attraction is being built. The hill is made out of 3 million m3 bottom ash, the residue of the nearby household waste incinerator. The responsible organisation points out it is an artwork.
